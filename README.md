# Text-Summarization-using-Transformers
**Streamlining Text Summarization with Transformer Models**__

This repository provides a Python script demonstrating text summarization using transformers, leveraging the power of state-of-the-art natural language processing models. Text summarization is a vital task in natural language processing that condenses lengthy documents or articles into concise summaries while retaining essential information.

**Overview**
Text summarization involves condensing large amounts of text into shorter versions, capturing the main points and key details. Traditional methods often struggle to maintain coherence and relevance in the summaries. However, with the advent of transformer-based models like BERT, GPT, and T5, text summarization has seen significant advancements. This repository utilizes the Hugging Face transformers library, which provides easy-to-use interfaces to pre-trained transformer models for various NLP tasks, including text summarization. By fine-tuning these models on specific summarization datasets or using them out-of-the-box, accurate and coherent summaries can be generated from input text.

**Features**

_Web Scraping:_ The script demonstrates how to scrape web content using the BeautifulSoup library, extracting relevant text for summarization.
_Preprocessing:_ Text preprocessing techniques are applied to prepare the input text for summarization, including sentence segmentation and chunking.
_Summarization:_ Leveraging the transformers library, the script utilizes pre-trained models for text summarization, generating concise summaries while controlling length and preserving important information.
_Customization:_ Users can adjust parameters such as maximum and minimum summary length to tailor the summarization process according to their requirements.
_Scalability:_ The script is designed to handle large volumes of text efficiently, making it suitable for summarizing lengthy articles, research papers, or documents.

**Getting Started**

To use the text summarization script:
a) Install the required libraries: transformers, beautifulsoup4, and requests.
b) Clone this repository to your local machine.
c) Run the script, providing the URL of the web page you want to summarize as input.
